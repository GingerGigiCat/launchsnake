# launchsnake
The game snake, coded for the launchpad X. This could probably be adapted to other launchpads pretty easily.

## Controls
Swiping gestures are used for controls. I put way too much effort into making these work nicely.

## Score
At the end of the game, the score is displayed as lines of blue pixels. The number of these pixels is your score.

## Making Changes
If you think something should be added or changed, just make an issue or a pull request.
Additionally, if there is weird behaviour, make an issue on github and I might look into it. If you don't get a response in a few weeks, just ping me.
